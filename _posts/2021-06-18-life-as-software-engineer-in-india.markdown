### WFH(WORK FROM HOME):The Good Cakes
	So, being a software engineer has become really common thing today.
and with the help of cheapest internet option in india, every people has internet in their hands more than ever before.

since internet is widely available working from anywhere is never been easier,
I worked in Banglore for a year before the pandamic happpened. I was away from my parents for so long. I was so happy to rebound with them, back then i was thinking it will be over in a month or so. 

The initial days are so good actually. I was able to spend so much time with my family. and I was able to save a lot of money. as i wasnt travelling much and i didnt spend anymoney since i live in a remote village.

Didnt order any unhealthy foods. I was able understand and connect with my family more than ever in my life.


### THE WORST
 Since we are working from home our colleagues wont know what we are doing and wont know what kind of situation we were in, 

Scenario:
	I worked continuosly one fine morning i forgot to have my breakfast, after a 3hr unhealthy coding session i went for my lunch at 1pm, I am getting a call from the office reagarding some issue. 

this is one example scenario, where i find difficulty in working from home.
which happens more frequently than you thin.

If i work in office, i wont be asked by anyone in home to go to shop for any stuffs. since i am working in between my coding session my mom or someone from my family needs me for something where i need stop what im doing, this usually will affect my flow where i would have had something in mind and it gets interuppted and i will forget what i was supposed to do.

Which made me think that office wasnt bad, it kept me productive

Being With family is one advantage none of us can avoid. üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®
