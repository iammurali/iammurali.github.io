## WHY TAILWIND

	I was always a person, who used templates to build my websites (i.e) any open source
templates i found, i will clone and start tweaking it to make it look like the way i want. whichin most case makes my life easier and faster to complete.

	However recently i saw tailwind getting a lot of its popularity from the community of developers and i wanted to use it. which made want to build a admin dashboard for a simple project that im working on.

	The documentation is not that easy to understand, there aren't many examples for layours or simple templates, like how bootstrap provides. still anyone who isn't a beginner can still uunderstand the fairbit of basicss.

## WHY NEXTJS
	I hate the face that i have to use the `react-router-dom` to do simple things, where next.js provides one of best ways for routing. where your folder stucture defines the routes. and one more advantage that i see is SSR(server side rendering), it makes life a whole lot more easier compared to other frameworks.
