why vim?
	This is my journey on coding and doing my work on vim as my ide.

I chose vim because of the hype sorrounding it and the amount of time that people claim that will be reduced by using vim. 

I took it as a experiment and im trying to setup and code my personal projects only in vim,

There are two famous choices among vim users 
 *  vim 
 *  nvim

I will research more and update about both vim and nvim here.

To be updated.....
