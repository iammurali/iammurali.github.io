### GETX
    I was using flutter with bloc pattern for a year and half now, the implementation with bloc pattern involves a lot of boiler plate code that needs to be written to properly stucture the code. This surely bamboozle a new comer who doesn't know anything about state management. 

    When I first saw Getx, i started to explore more about it and turns its really simpler and the most efficient way to implement state management in flutter

## When can i use it?
    The way i see it is you can almost use it in any project you want, even for small projects since the amount of boiler plate code that your have to type almost none.

    Learn GETX using the documentation, it states everything pretty clear.
