### POP OS COSMIC
I was using pop os 20.04 for so long on my g14 and i decided to install the all new 
pop os 21.04 cosmic. instead of upgrading i managed mess up my whole system by installing gnome 40. and i felt its not worth spending my time on fixing and i would rather install the latest version

## What works
`In short everything works`

The out of the box experience is solid, everything works as expected. even on the last pop os version i had to install asus-ctl and other stuff to get the keyboad backlight and some stuff to works.

With the new pop os everything works out of the box thanks to the new kernel 5.12
which ensures everything works

### Issues

For some reason scaling on linux never worked great for me. Since this is 14inch 1080p panel everything looks so small and unusable for my eyes and i tried fractional scaling with 125% and its looked janky and i didnt like it.
`Then i figured out a way i can sort this out`


### How i fixed it?
GNOME-TWEAKS

the saviour - go to your pop shop and search for `gnome tweaks` and install it

After installing gnome tweaks open and open the fonts section and change the font scaling factior to 1.25 or anything of your preference since 1.25 worked perfectly for me and Voila.!
