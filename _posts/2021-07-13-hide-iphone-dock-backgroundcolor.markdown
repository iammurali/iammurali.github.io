# Hide your Iphone dock with this magical wallpaper

	Hi, I have been usin the iphone 11 for more than 6months and i like to play around with my wallpapers often. one day when i was roaming in weebly. i found that people were making cool wallapapers that can hide the dock of your iphone.


There is more option for wallpapers like hiding both folder name and dock background.


The last option will be hiding dock in light mode

Here are the wallpapers for download in FULL RES:
