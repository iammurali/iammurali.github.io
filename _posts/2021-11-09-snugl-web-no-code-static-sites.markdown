### I created a no code static editor in a week


## Why Snuggle
I named the product as snugl web (snuggle), where snuggle means moving or settling into a comfortable place
thinking that building static sites should be as simple as drag and drop. i am a full time software developer
for a investment banking company. 

Every now and then i was approached by my relatives and a people from my place approach me with a request for
developing a website for their business. they are mostly from a non tech background and i had to say no to everyone
due to my regular work and time constraint and money.

Usually it takes a day or two to create a website for people.

I took this as an opportunity to build a product that
will be used to create a full static 

## Idea
I thought of creating a tool with electron and publish it as a tool rather than a website later i realised the people
i was approached by where not tech savy enough to download a product for pc and install it. 

After talking to my friend who is very good at react and javascript. he sort'a walked me through the challenges 
and hurdles that i will be facing during development and we agreed on to create a POC where i will start the POC.


## Development 

I got some confidence and started building the
website in next.js the version i started with is next.js 12

I used *TailwindCss* due to it low overhead setup. the nextjs installation is supersimple
refer tailwind documentation.

I coded the entire POC in 5hours of time and approached my friend with that idea.



## MVP and release 

I finished the mvp with some help from my friend, later deployed the entire MVP application in vercel
the release version is under the website 

Im very happy with the first release of the application and i would like to implement inline edit for the website.
