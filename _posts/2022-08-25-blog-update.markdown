## What happeneds

It's been a long time and i have stopped writing for a long time and life hasnt been good for the past 6months. and here i am finding my energy back to write this blog

I havent updated the blog look and feel in a while. Right now we are using the default minima theme by jekyll and i would like to improve the look and feel.

## what are we gonna do

I searching for a list themes i could find that is both minimal and aesthetic

so there is an option in jekyll to use remote theme directly
all i had to do was this and setting the theme to mint

`remote_theme: owner/name`
`theme: mint`

i love how this has turned out
