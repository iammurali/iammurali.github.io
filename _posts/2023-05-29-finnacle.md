## I built a finance tracking app (Work in progress for india ready feature)

I built this app for myself and all the features i have included are mandatory for my workflow, I started the app with a small intention in mind that it needs to be offline, later realised that i need someway to export and share the data to do further analysis. this the most basic version of the application

### How it started?

There is nothing special, i just built it for fun and for tracking my own expenses

### Does it work?

It does work, i was initially building this for iphone as i cannot sideload apps on iphone the test flight version deletes all sql data after a certain amount of time which i dont want to spend time or money to make it work at that poin of time. 

I have decided to publish an android version as github release which is progress as of (29-5-23). the app works, you have the ability to add or delete expenses and track the loans and debts you have give.

### Where can i find the project

You can find the project in my github:

### What are all the things i'm planning to add?
- Add Statistics page
- Add CSV/Excel export
- Add Online backup solution or Offline sync

### How can you help:
- I am looking for flutter contributors who can help on my project
